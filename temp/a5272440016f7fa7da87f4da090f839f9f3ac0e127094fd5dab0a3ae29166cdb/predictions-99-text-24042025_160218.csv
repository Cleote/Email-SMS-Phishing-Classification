 Spending on Rich Internet Applications is going to exceed $500M by 2011 !
“It's really time for US enterprises to start switching to the Web as a platform for application delivery. They have stayed in the client-server world for too long, compared to the rapid adoption of Web 2.0 in the consumer space. The easiest way for stepping up to Web 2.0 (Web as a platform) is through the door called RIA.”
								  - BERT HALSTEAD
								  Chief Architect, Curl
For today's (and tomorrow's) applications that run via the Web, should they be AJAX-based - or do AIR/Flash/Flex, JavaFX, or Silverlight offer better results? And what about Appcelerator, OpenLaszlo, or Curl, or any of the other many open source alternatives that have emerged? 
To inspire you to come to AJAXWorld 2008 East and choose your direction for Rich Internet Applications, we bring you here the entire Conference Program, from which you can see that there are sessions covering just about ever RIA technology currently available, whether your interest is AIR 1.0, Flex 2 and 3, Curl 5.0, Open Laszlo 4.0, Silverlight 2.0, Rico 2.0, Zend Framework 1.5, Grails 1.0, Groovy 1.5 - you name it, we have speakers who are knowledgeable about it and giving a session or part of a session about it.
 
Come see why, as a recent ZapThink report predicted,  spending on RIAs is going to exceed $500 million dollars by 2011. No company developing web applications can afford to wait any longer to solidify their Rich Internet Application strategy: 2008 is the Decision Year for RIAs.
				
2008 is the year that US enterprises are switching in increasing numbers to the Web as a platform for application delivery, and 2008 too will for many enterprises be the Decision Year for their choice of RIA platform. Make that choice in New York City in March! AJAXWorld Conference & Expo is the place to be if you want easy access under one roof to a welter of resources, ideas and examples to help you decide.
The extensive Expo floor additionally will allow you to follow up on the premier solutions already available and to choose which best suits your needs. In short, AJAXWorld is where you can discover everything you're going to need for business survival and Web success in 2008. 								
								
Hope to see you in New York City at the 6th International AJAXWorld !

I'm not sure I can personally offer much here, le dahut, but
it would help if you showed the traceback you *are* getting.
Surely there's some clue in there which might suggest why
you're prevented from rebooting before a delay period.

The bit of Time::Piece you can't see has a custom strptime function
which is what I was really after.  The strcasecmp define is just
part of the prologue to that, and isn't needed elsewhere.

Improving .NET Application Performance and Reliability with Managed Database Data Connectivity  
            
Many .NET applications fail to meet user requirements because they do not provide optimal access to underlying Oracle, Sybase, or DB2 databases. The root cause is often unmanaged ADO.NET data providers shipped by the database vendor or from Microsoft. In this paper, SQL Server MVP and SSWUG co-founder Stephen Wynkoop explores common misperceptions about data access technologies, describes the optimum architecture for ADO.NET data providers, and highlights key selection criteria for developers.

I think it's fine, in general, just so long as no-one checks in anything
that puts it into my test corpus.
Or alternately, whatever is chosen should be ignored by the tokenizer. 
I know my mail host (interlink) runs SA, but I also run it, with my own
set of rules and scores. I don't want my spam-filter to be getting messed
up by an upstream spam filter.",legitimate,99.3

It uses the plain nv driver instead, which comes with the X server. Ie, 
the configuration, instead of declaring the driver as ""nvidia"", declares 
""nv"". It is far more stable, but has no 3d nor hw accel graphics.
